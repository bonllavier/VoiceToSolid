# VoiceToSolid
VoiceToSolid is a WebApplication that from voice commands, it create solids based on the voice commands entered in the microphone device, in order to paint in and HTML canvas a 3D geometry that can be see with colors and rotation.
For future releases we are going to implement not only regular Geometric forms, but more complex 3d models, and design a interaction system between the objects instantiated.

## Technologies Used
-The technologies in the minimum initial product used will be the following:
### -Three.js
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.
Three.js allows the creation of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated 3D animations using the JavaScript language as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins. This is possible due to the advent of WebGL.
### -Recorder.js
A plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes
https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs
### -Bootstrap (front-end framework)
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
### -Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
