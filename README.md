# VoiceToSolid
VoiceToSolid is a WebApplication that from voice commands, it create solids based on the commands entered, these can be mutated from the commands received after the first, or can be interactives.
For future releases we are going to implement not only regular Geometric forms, but more complex 3d models, a design a interaction system between the objects instantiated.

## Team Members
- Ximena Carolina Andrade Vargas
- Giovanny Rubio Albornoz
- Javier Bonilla Mite

## What role will each person play in completing the project?
-Ximena mostly will contribute by polishing the presentation of the product, focusing on determining if the minimum requirements are met and if the product is friendly and can be used without much inconvenience by many users and programming the graphic interface.
This is decided thanks to the experience she has as a mechatronic engineer and psychologist.

-Giovanny has more experience as a front end developer, therefore he will be the one who is in charge of the presentation and the functionality of the project, Also verifying common errors, in the interface, and making the experience more friendly, thanks to their experience.

-Javier, he is responsible for the implementation of APIs, and the application of databases. Logo and icon design. I have decided to take care of that part, to improve my skills in those aspects.

## Technologies Used
-The technologies in the minimum initial product used will be the following:
### -Three.js
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.
Three.js allows the creation of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated 3D animations using the JavaScript language as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins. This is possible due to the advent of WebGL.

### -Bootstrap (front-end framework)
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
### -Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

#### The technologies applied in a more advanced phase are the following:

### -Ionic - Cross-Platform Mobile App Development
Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013. The original version was released in 2013 and built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova. However, The latest release was re-built as a set of Web Components, allowing the user to choose any user interface framework, such as Angular, React or Vue.js. It also allows the use of Ionic components with no user interface framework at all. Ionic provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile, desktop, and Progressive Web Apps based on modern web development technologies and practices, using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass. In particular, mobile apps can be built with these Web technologies and then distributed through native app stores to be installed on devices by utilizing Cordova or Capacitor.
